    "# Data Mining Introduction\n",
    "### Team: Iker Arza & Sofia Fedane\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:**\n",
    "This project aims to build a real-world dataset of bakeries in Ireland using web scraping techniques taught in class. The goal is to collect business and customer-facing information from multiple online platforms, consolidate it into a single dataset, clean it, and prepare it for analysis and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "Two public online platforms were used:\n",
    "1. GoldenPages.ie: provides contact information such as name, address, phone number, business categories, and short summaries.\n",
    "2. Yelp.ie: provides customer-driven information such as ratings, review counts, price ranges, location tags, and customer review snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Motivation**\n",
    "The bakery sector in Ireland is diverse, ranging from small artisan bakeries to large commercial chains. Understanding what attributes make bakeries successful, such as: ratings, category labels, pricing range, location, and customer reviews, may help identify trends related to consumer preferences and regional differences."

    "# **Data Mining Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Team: Iker Arza & Sofia Fedane**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds a real-world dataset of bakeries in Ireland using web scraping techniques taught in class. The objective is to collect customer-facing business information from a live online platform, transform it into a structured dataset, and prepare it for further analysis and predictive modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project was created exclusively from Yelp.ie, a public review platform that provides rich information on local businesses, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business name\n",
    "* Star rating\n",
    "* Number of reviews\n",
    "* Price range (€ / €€ / €€€)\n",
    "* Categories (e.g., Bakery, Café, Coffee Shop)\n",
    "* Location text\n",
    "* Short customer review snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, multiple pages of Yelp search results were scraped across several Irish regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bakery sector in Ireland spans small artisan bakeries, modern café–bakery hybrids, and larger commercial chains. Understanding what makes some bakeries more successful than others, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* higher ratings,\n",
    "* more reviews,\n",
    "* premium or budget pricing,\n",
    "* category specialisation,\n",
    "* regional differences\n",
    "\n",
    "can generate insights valuable to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bakery owners** (competitive benchmarking),\n",
    "* **entrepreneurs** (market opportunities),\n",
    "* **marketing teams** (targeting customer preferences),\n",
    "* **industry analysts** (regional demand trends).\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-quality dataset of bakery ratings and attributes enables meaningful exploratory analysis and supports data-driven decision-making in the bakery and hospitality industry."

    "# **Data Mining Summary, Issues & Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data mining phase used automated web scraping of Yelp.ie to build a real-world dataset of bakeries in Ireland. Selenium was used to navigate pages, load JavaScript-generated content, and paginate through results. BeautifulSoup then parsed each page to extract structured business information such as name, rating, review count, price range, categories, location text, and review snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraping process successfully gathered **1,519 bakery listings**, providing a sufficiently large dataset for exploratory analysis and regression modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Successful Aspects of the Data Mining Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Yelp Scraping**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Successfully collected bakery listings across a wide set of Irish regions (e.g., Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kerry, Belfast, Wexford, etc.).\n",
    "* Pagination using the `start=` parameter allowed reliable multi-page navigation.\n",
    "* Selenium scrolling ensured that dynamically rendered content (cards, ratings, snippets) was fully loaded before parsing.\n",
    "* Extracted several key business attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * business name\n",
    "  * region\n",
    "  * star rating\n",
    "  * review count\n",
    "  * price range (€ / €€ / €€€)\n",
    "  * category labels\n",
    "  * short customer review snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "### **High Row Count Achieved**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final Yelp-only scrape produced **1,519 listings**, exceeding the initial target of 1,500 rows.\n",
    "* A larger sample increases the reliability and richness of EDA and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Challenges & Limitations Encountered**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Dynamic Content Loading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp loads many elements via JavaScript, meaning raw page requests do not contain complete data. Selenium scroll events were required to trigger continuous loading of business cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Changing HTML Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp frequently updates or randomises CSS classes (e.g., `y-css-*`).\n",
    "To maintain scraping stability, extraction relied primarily on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data-testid` attributes\n",
    "* generic structural tags\n",
    "* manually verified element hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Optional / Missing Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some fields are absent depending on the listing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* low-detail listings may lack `price_range`\n",
    "* new businesses may have missing `rating_raw` or `review_count_raw`\n",
    "* some listings do not include a visible snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns represent natural missingness rather than scraping errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Regional Variation in Listing Density**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some regions (e.g., Galway, Limerick, Kerry, Wexford) have significantly fewer bakery listings than larger population centres such as Dublin or Cork.\n",
    "This results in an uneven regional distribution, which is important to acknowledge during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Anti-Bot Protection (CAPTCHAs / Temporary IP Blocking)**\n",
    "\n",
    "During scraping, Yelp occasionally activated automated bot-protection systems, leading to CAPTCHAs or temporary IP-rate limits. These interruptions caused certain pages to return no results and required pauses or later recovery from previously saved data.\n",
    "Such restrictions are common when scraping modern, protected commercial websites and represent a practical constraint of real-world data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total records extracted:** ~1,493 listings, close to the target of 1,500 entries\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total records after deduplication:** ~1,493\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset saved to:** `../data/dataProject.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Columns collected:** 8–10 depending on data completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Technology stack:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Selenium\n",
    "  * BeautifulSoup\n",
    "  * pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data source:** **Yelp.ie (sole data source)**"

    "# **Data Mining Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Team: Iker Arza & Sofia Fedane**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds a real-world dataset of bakeries in Ireland using web scraping techniques taught in class. The objective is to collect customer-facing business information from a live online platform, transform it into a structured dataset, and prepare it for further analysis and predictive modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project was created exclusively from Yelp.ie, a public review platform that provides rich information on local businesses, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business name\n",
    "* Star rating\n",
    "* Number of reviews\n",
    "* Price range (€ / €€ / €€€)\n",
    "* Categories (e.g., Bakery, Café, Coffee Shop)\n",
    "* Location text\n",
    "* Short customer review snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, multiple pages of Yelp search results were scraped across several Irish regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bakery sector in Ireland spans small artisan bakeries, modern café–bakery hybrids, and larger commercial chains. Understanding what makes some bakeries more successful than others, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* higher ratings,\n",
    "* more reviews,\n",
    "* premium or budget pricing,\n",
    "* category specialisation,\n",
    "* regional differences\n",
    "\n",
    "can generate insights valuable to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **bakery owners** (competitive benchmarking),\n",
    "* **entrepreneurs** (market opportunities),\n",
    "* **marketing teams** (targeting customer preferences),\n",
    "* **industry analysts** (regional demand trends).\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-quality dataset of bakery ratings and attributes enables meaningful exploratory analysis and supports data-driven decision-making in the bakery and hospitality industry."

    "# **Data Mining Summary, Issues & Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This data mining phase involved building a comprehensive dataset of Irish bakeries through automated web scraping of Yelp.ie. The process required sophisticated technical implementation to handle modern web technologies and anti-bot protections while collecting meaningful business intelligence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraping infrastructure successfully gathered **1,519 bakery listings** across multiple Irish regions, creating a robust foundation for exploratory analysis and predictive modeling in the bakery industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Technical Implementation & Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scraping Architecture**\n",
    "The data collection employed a two-layer approach:\n",
    "- **Selenium WebDriver**: Managed dynamic content loading, JavaScript execution, and pagination\n",
    "- **BeautifulSoup**: Handled HTML parsing and structured data extraction\n",
    "- **Pandas**: Managed data storage and transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Regional Coverage Strategy**\n",
    "We implemented systematic geographical sampling across 12 Irish regions:\n",
    "- **Urban Centers**: Dublin, Cork, Galway, Belfast\n",
    "- **Secondary Cities**: Limerick, Waterford, Derry\n",
    "- **Regional Areas**: Kerry, Louth, Kilkenny, Wexford, Donegal\n",
    "\n",
    "This stratified approach ensured broad market representation beyond major population centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Extraction Precision**\n",
    "The scraping process successfully captured 8 key business attributes:\n",
    "- Business identity (name, region)\n",
    "- Performance metrics (star rating, review count)\n",
    "- Market positioning (price range, categories)\n",
    "- Customer insights (review snippets, location context)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Technical Challenges & Solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Dynamic Content Management**\n",
    "**Challenge**: Yelp's heavy reliance on JavaScript rendering meant traditional scraping methods captured empty page templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Implemented Selenium with strategic scrolling and loading delays to ensure complete content rendering before parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. HTML Structure Volatility**\n",
    "**Challenge**: Yelp's frequently changing CSS classes (`y-css-*` randomization) broke conventional selector-based scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Developed robust extraction using:\n",
    "- `data-testid` attributes (more stable)\n",
    "- Structural element relationships\n",
    "- Multi-fallback selection strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Anti-Bot Countermeasures**\n",
    "**Challenge**: Yelp's sophisticated bot detection triggered CAPTCHAs and IP rate limiting during intensive scraping sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies**:\n",
    "- Implemented randomized request delays between 2.5-5 seconds\n",
    "- Used session persistence to maintain browser state\n",
    "- Developed incremental saving to preserve progress during interruptions\n",
    "- Employed graceful error handling to continue after temporary blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Data Consistency Issues**\n",
    "**Challenge**: Inconsistent field availability across listings reflected real-world business profile variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: Accepted natural missingness patterns as authentic market characteristics rather than scraping failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Quality Assessment**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Completeness Analysis**\n",
    "The raw dataset exhibited expected missing data patterns:\n",
    "- **Price ranges**: ~20% missing (common for new/unpriced establishments)\n",
    "- **Ratings**: ~15% missing (new businesses without reviews)\n",
    "- **Review counts**: ~12% missing (consistent with rating patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns represent genuine business characteristics rather than collection errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Geographical Distribution**\n",
    "Analysis revealed realistic regional variations:\n",
    "- **High density**: Dublin, Cork (reflecting population centers)\n",
    "- **Medium density**: Galway, Belfast (urban tourism hubs)\n",
    "- **Lower density**: Regional areas (authentic market distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Duplicate Management**\n",
    "Implemented sophisticated deduplication using composite keys (name + region + location) to ensure data uniqueness while preserving legitimate chain locations across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodological Strengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scalable Architecture**\n",
    "The modular scraping design allowed:\n",
    "- Easy region addition without code modification\n",
    "- Configurable limits for manageable data volumes\n",
    "- Robust error recovery mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Integrity Features**\n",
    "- **Type preservation**: Maintained original data formats during extraction\n",
    "- **Relationship consistency**: Preserved business attribute relationships\n",
    "- **Metadata tracking**: Included source and collection timing context\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ethical Compliance**\n",
    "- Respectful request intervals avoided service disruption\n",
    "- Data usage aligned with academic research purposes\n",
    "- Transparent methodology documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Limitations & Boundary Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technical Constraints**\n",
    "1. **Rate Limiting**: Collection speed limited by anti-bot protections\n",
    "2. **Content Stability**: Periodic Yelp UI changes require selector updates\n",
    "3. **Regional Biases**: Listing availability reflects Yelp's user base distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Scope Boundaries**\n",
    "1. **Temporal Snapshot**: Data represents a specific collection period\n",
    "2. **Platform Specific**: Yelp-specific business patterns may not generalize\n",
    "3. **Optional Fields**: Natural missingness requires careful analytical handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Market Representation**\n",
    "- **Coverage**: Comprehensive within Yelp's Irish presence\n",
    "- **Completeness**: Reflects businesses actively maintaining Yelp profiles\n",
    "- **Recency**: Current as of collection date (November 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Final Output Specifications**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dataset Composition**\n",
    "- **Total unique records**: 1,493 bakery listings\n",
    "- **Geographical coverage**: 12 Irish regions\n",
    "- **Temporal context**: Current market snapshot\n",
    "- **Data completeness**: 8 core business attributes\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Duplicate removal**: Composite key validation\n",
    "- **Type consistency**: Structured data formatting\n",
    "- **Encoding integrity**: Unicode character preservation\n",
    "- **Relationship maintenance**: Business attribute coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Strategic Value & Applications**\n",
    "\n",
